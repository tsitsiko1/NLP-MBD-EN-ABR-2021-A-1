    "The purpose of this practical session is to gain more insight into using parsers and grammars and to get familiarized with the tools provided to this end by NLTK.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our goals are to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the process of parsing better by doing some examples by hand.\n",
    "- Gain insight into grammars by writing a grammar of our own.\n",
    "- Experiment with training a grammar from a corpus and evaluating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The practical session is organized in four sections:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The warm-up, where you are going to use a given toy grammar to generate parse trees and get a chance to compare your intuition with the results provided by the NLTK parsers.\n",
    "- Then, you will need to design and test your own grammar, again, for a small example.\n",
    "- Next, you will automatically extract a grammar from a corpus of annotated sentences.\n",
    "- Finally, you are going to explore ways to improve automatically extracted grammars, through error analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving in, it would be useful to have a look at how NLTK handles parsing. At the end of the Notebook, you will find a summary of the most useful commands.
